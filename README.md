# Project Todos
The project was to build a Todo web-app using React and Redux.


# My todo's
This app is built using store, reducers and components.

Some of the functionalities:
* The user can not add an empty message because the add-button is not active until two letters are written.
* The app keep track of how many tasks have been completed.
* The user can delete completed tasks or delete all.
* The user can set all tasks as completed.
* The user can check and un-check a task, see the date it was created, and delete a single task.
* When there is no tasks left, the user gets a message.

It's styled to look best in mobile.
